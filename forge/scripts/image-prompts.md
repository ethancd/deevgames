# FORGE Card Image Prompts

## Global Style Prefix

Applied to all cards:

```
Card artwork for FORGE, a cosmic alchemical strategy card game. Square 1:1 aspect ratio. No text, letters, words, or writing of any kind. No frames, borders, or card-like edges - the art fills the entire image. Dark fantasy meets cosmic horror with alchemical symbolism. Baroque sci-fi aesthetic - ornate machinery fused with organic growth, ancient symbols glowing with unnatural light. Heavy shadows with dramatic rim lighting. Rich textures: tarnished metals, iridescent chitin, crystalline structures. Background color must be strongly dominated by the faction's signature colors. Center focus on subject with atmospheric gradients. Ominous grandeur, forces beyond human scale.
```

## Faction Themes

### Crimson Covenant
```
Biology as warfare. Chitinous armor plates, pulsing organic tissue, thorn-covered vines with intent. Bio-engineered predators: sleek, fast, covered in natural weapons. Xenomorphic creatures crossed with carnivorous plants. Deep burgundy, crimson, dark pink flesh tones against black chitin. Wounds sprout new growth.
```

### Iron Tide
```
Brutal industrial warfare. Massive constructs of riveted steel, exhaust ports belching dark smoke, crushing treads. War machines - no pretense of humanity, just function and firepower. WW1 tanks meets steampunk walker meets brutalist architecture. Gunmetal grey, dark steel blues, brass accents, rust. Surfaces scarred from combat.
```

### Void Legion
```
The breaking of order. Twisted humanoid forms - too many limbs, geometries that don't connect right, faces hidden. Cultist aesthetics meets cosmic horror: tattered robes revealing something not quite flesh, ceremonial weapons dripping with malice. Deep blacks with purple edges, sickly yellows, void-deep purples. Shadows don't behave correctly.
```

### Silk Network
```
Wealth as power, information as currency. Ornate armor - gold filigree, amber inlays, silk accents. Diplomat-assassins with hidden blades, merchant-princes with bodyguards, envoys with deadly grace. Renaissance intrigue meets asian merchant guilds meets surveillance. Rich golds, deep ambers, bronze, cream silk, data-stream blue highlights.
```

### Dream Garden
```
Nature is neither kind nor cruel. Robed figures tending impossible flora, guardians more plant than person, plants given terrible purpose. Sacred grove meets psychedelic nightmare: bioluminescent flowers with too many petals, trees with bark like eyes, moss in sacred geometric patterns. Soft teals, seafoam greens, moonlit silvers, lavender.
```

### Ghost Protocol
```
Information warfare in physical form. Agents in tactical gear with digital camouflage that glitches and shifts, shadows given form, data entities manifesting in meatspace. Cyberpunk espionage meets digital ghost stories. Pale greys, silver-blues, null-space blacks, scanline greens, error-message red accents. Half-phased out of reality.
```

### General
```
Remnants and results of cosmic war. Supply drops, abandoned materiel, hastily-fortified positions, battle-scarred professionals. Utilitarian tans, military greens, weathered browns, neutral greys. War's supporting cast - essential but not glorious.
```
