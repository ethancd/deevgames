njt,Object of the Game,"In the fog of war, you can't always be sure where your enemies await you... especially if they're a ninja.\nFire arcing shots over the center wall to destroy your enemy while avoiding their shots through stealth and cleverness.\nOh, and try not to blow yourself while you're at it."
njt,Object of the Game,"You win by outlasting your opponent's tank. If the enemy's tank is destroyed by cannon fire or overheating (they reach 9 damage or more), and your tank isn't, you win at the end of the turn.\nIf both players have 9 damage or more at the end of a turn, both tanks are destroyed and it's a tie."
njt,Starting Position,"Both players start on their respective middle spaces (marked ""2""), with a hand of 3 cards.\nThe first turn starts at the ""Play"" phase."
njt,Draw,"Each player draws 1, 2, or 3 cards.\nIf you draw more cards than the number of the zone where your actual tank is, you take overheating damage (one damage token).\nIf you draw more cards than the number of the zone where one of your decoys is, but not more than your current position, you <em>appear to your opponent</em> to take overheating damage. But don't worry, it's fake, and doesn't add to your damage total.\nIf the deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile and use it as the new deck."
njt,Play,"Both players select the action (or actions) they want to take this turn.\nThe three types of actions are Move, Feint, and Fire.\nTo do an action, you must play a card with that action on it.\nIf you take two actions, you take overheating damage (one damage token)."
njt,Resolve Moves,"Moves are always resolved before shots.\nWhen you use the arrow side of a card as your action, your opponent doesn't know whether you chose to move or fake them out.\nBoth possibilities are represented on the board by see-through tanks. (Your actual tank stays solid for you.)"
njt,Resolve Shots,"Any shot that hits an actual tank deals cannon damage (two damage tokens).\nAfter all shots are resolved, any tank positions revealed to be decoys are removed.\n(Note: if shots are fired at two spaces and one is a hit, it is not revealed which space it was.)"
njt,Discard,"If you have more than 3 cards in hand, discard until you only have 3.\nYou cannot discard down to less than 3 cards."
njt,End of Turn,"If either player has taken 9 or more damage, their tank is destroyed.\nThey lose and their opponent wins, unless their opponent's tank was destroyed too, in which case it's a tie."
