## Per-engine turn timing (AMENDMENTS-DECIDED A4)

Allowance: wall:6000.
Tolerance: max(10ms,1%), frozen (AMENDMENTS-DECIDED A14) = 60 ms at this allowance. overAllowance counts any ms past the allowance; overruns counts the turns past the tolerance; overrunRate = overruns / turns, and above 5% for either arm the row is VOID (AMENDMENTS-DECIDED A14).

## How the search stopped (AMENDMENTS-DECIDED A16)

abortedSearches: searches the engine abandoned on its watchdog rather than on its work rung — under A11 that watchdog is the turn's remaining allowance, so this counts the moves the CLOCK chose. abortRate = abortedSearches / searches. firstSearchAborted: games whose FIRST search was one of them (the cold profile, still INITIAL_UNITS_PER_MS, has measured nothing yet). emptyPlans: searches that returned no actions, where the adapter ends the phase through phaseEndAction (A10). Counted PER SEAT since E1.5 (PlayerGameStats.hardTiming), so a Hard-vs-Hard row attributes them per arm; older records fall back to the process-wide counters, which only a run with one hard@ arm can own. n/a means neither source says anything about this arm — never that the count was zero.
